        What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline
        CSS?
        <p>
          <strong>External CSS:</strong>This is additional file that we create
          our styles. File name can be anything; however, it has to have '.css'
          extention at the end of the file. It has to be linked with the HTML
          file inside of the head section.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Internal CSS:</strong>
          is used to define a style for a single HTML page. An internal CSS is
          defined in the head section of an HTML page, within a style element.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Inline CSS:</strong>may be used to apply a unique style for a
          single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the
          relevant element.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?
        <p>
          For the class syntax it is used point '.' and for the id syntax it is
          used hashtag sign '#'
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?
        <p>
          We can write the two selectors next to each other with a coma between
          them like that: div, p{color: #000}
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how
        would you use both attributes for a single rule?
        <p>#title, .primary{}</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What does the descendant combinator do?
        <p>
          Combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second
          selector are selected if they have an ancestor (parent) element
          matching the first selector. For example if we want to target p elemnt
          inside of a div element we can write like div p{}
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three
        type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?
        <p>Class selector has the higher specificity.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties?
        <p>Content-padding-border-margin</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What does the box-sizing CSS property do?
        <p>
          The box-sizing property defines how the width and height of an element
          are calculated: should they include padding and borders, or not.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model?
        <p>
          With the standart box model, the size of the border is added to the
          width and height of the box. With the alternative box model, the size
          of the border makes the content box smaller as it takes up some of
          that available width and height.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Would you use margin or padding to create more space between 2 elements?
        <p>For creating space between the two elements we can use margin.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Would you use margin or padding to create more space between the
        contents of an element and its border?
        <p>
          For creating space between the content of an element and its border we
          can use padding.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Would you use margin or padding if you wanted two elements to overlap
        each other?
        <p>We should use margin for overlapping elements.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between a block element and an inline element?
        <p>
          A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers
          automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
          An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as
          much width as necessary.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between an inline element and an inline-block
        element?
        <p>
          Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that inline-block
          allows to set a width and height on the element. Also, with display:
          inline, top and bottom margins & paddings are not respected, and with
          display: inline-block they are.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Is an h1 block or inline?
        <p>h1 is a block element.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Is button block or inline?
        <p>button is an inline level element.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Is div block or inline?
        <p>Div is a block-level element.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Is span block or inline?
        <p>Span is an inline level element.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What’s the difference between a flex container and a flex item?
        <p>What’s the difference between a flex container and a flex item?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you create a flex item?
        <p>We create an element inside of a div tag in the flex container.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are the 3 values defined in the shorthand flex property?
        <p>Flex is a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of
        horizontally?
        <p>We set the flex-direction: column;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between justify-content and align-items?
        <p>
          Justify-content is for horizantal aligning, align-items is for
          vertical aligning.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex
        container?
        <p>display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What’s the difference between justify-content: space-between and
        justify-content: space-around?
        <p>
          Space-between: First item is on the start line and the last item is on
          the end line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Space around: Items are evenly distributed in the line with equal
          space around them.
        </p>
